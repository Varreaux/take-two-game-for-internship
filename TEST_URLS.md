# Test These URLs to Find the Correct One

Try these URLs in your browser (one should work):

## Test 1: Root Endpoint (Should work first)
Open in browser: `https://varreaux-godot-ai-game.hf.space/`

If you see JSON with `{"status": "online", ...}`, then this URL works!
- Use for Godot: `https://varreaux-godot-ai-game.hf.space/generate`

## Test 2: Alternative Format
Open in browser: `https://huggingface.co/spaces/Varreaux/godot-ai-game`

If this shows your app, then the API might be:
- `https://huggingface.co/spaces/Varreaux/godot-ai-game/generate`

## Test 3: Check API Docs
1. Go to your Space: `https://huggingface.co/spaces/Varreaux/godot-ai-game`
2. Look for an "API docs" link or button
3. Click it - the URL bar will show the correct base URL
4. Then add `/generate` to that URL

## What to Do Next

**Tell me which URL works** (the one that shows the JSON response), and I'll update your Godot code!
